# Regression_analysis

## Overview
This project is a car price regression analysis implemented in Python using TensorFlow. The goal of the project is to predict the price of cars based on various features such as horsepower, year, Km, economy, and other relevant attributes. TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, is used to build and train the regression model.

## Installation
Install TensorFlow: Make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using pip.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the notebooks directory. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each cell and observe the results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about various cars, including their hp, kilometers, rating, economy, and other features. The dataset is provided in the data directory. The project notebook guides you through loading and exploring the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features. The preprocessing steps are crucial for training an effective regression model.

## Model Training
The regression model is built using TensorFlow's high-level API. The architecture is designed to take advantage of the features in the dataset and learn the mapping between car features and their prices.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess its performance on predicting car prices.
